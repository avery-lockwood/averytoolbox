# Most of the ipynb files in this repo should be run on a sagemath jupyter server. run sage -n jupyter on a linux machine with sagemath installed. I also like using vs code. you can copy and paste the link to the server address when selecting the kernel to run the file. There might be more steps to that but I dont have time to test at the moment.
